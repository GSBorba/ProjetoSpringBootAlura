In this project I develop a Rest API, using CRUD with validations, pagination and ordering. I used Java 17, Spring Boot 3 with Lombok, JPA and Hibernate, for the database I used MySQL with Flyway and for dependency management I used Maven.

This project is about a fictional medical clinic where we can do CRUD for doctors, patients or medical appointments.
